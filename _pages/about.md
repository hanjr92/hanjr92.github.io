About me
============
I'm a AI software engineer at Peng Cheng Lab. Before joining PCL, I obtained my master degree in 2014 form Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.
I obtained my B.S. degree in 2017 from National University of Defense Technology. My current areas of interests include deep learning, data science and computer vision. I enjoy learning and exploring.
